# NavMesh Movement WITHOUT Click to Move / SetDestination

In this tutorial repository you will learn how to make a NavMeshAgent traverse a NavMesh without using SetDestination nor the mouse to click-to-move. 
We'll use the keyboard to move the NavMeshAgent along the NavMesh instead, apply a configurable smoothing to the inputs so the agent doesn't abruptly swap directions and rotations.

The keyboard input in this repository supports both the new and old input systems. The video focuses only on the new input system.
